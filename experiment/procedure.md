## General Procedure for LC Oscillator Design
Choose Desired Oscillation Frequency (
ùëì
f):

Use the formula:
f = 1 / (2œÄ‚àö(LC))

 
Where:
 
Select Tank Circuit Components (L and C):

Decide values of inductance and capacitance to achieve the required frequency.

Ensure that the components are suitable for the frequency range (e.g., low losses at high frequencies).

## Choose Amplifying Device:

Usually a BJT (transistor) or FET is used to provide gain.

## Design Feedback Network:

Proper feedback is essential to sustain oscillations (as per Barkhausen Criterion).

## Assemble Circuit:

Connect tank circuit, amplifier, and feedback path as per the oscillator type.

## Simulate/Test the Circuit:

Use simulation software (like LTspice or Multisim) or breadboard the circuit.

Check waveform, frequency, and stability.

## Fine-Tune Components:

Adjust L or C to fine-tune the oscillation frequency if necessary.

## Feedback Mechanism
Feedback is taken from the junction of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>.

Provides positive feedback through mutual inductance.

Detailed StepsCircuit Components
One inductor (L)

Three capacitors (C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, and C<sub>3</sub>)

One transistor

Biasing resistors

Tank Circuit
L is in series with C<sub>3; the series branch is in parallel with C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>.

Oscillation Frequency
f = 1 / (2œÄ * sqrt(L * Ceq))

Where:

1 / C<sub>eq</sub> = 1 / C<sub>1</sub> + 1 / C<sub>2</sub> + 1 / C<sub>3</sub>
 
## Feedback Mechanism
Like Colpitts, with feedback from voltage divider (C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>).

Extra capacitor (C<sub>3</sub>) enhances frequency stability.

Tips for Practical Implementation
Use RF chokes and bypass capacitors to stabilize the power supply.

Choose high-Q components for better performance.

Shield the oscillator circuit to minimize noise.

If using simulation: Observe waveform, check startup, and verify frequency
